# EMBEDDED DEPTH ESTIMATION
## INTRODUCTION
 Ultrasonic sensors are excellent tools for measuring distance and detecting objects without making physical contact. 
 It has a variety of uses, including detecting liquid levels, determining proximity, and, more recently, assisting
 in self-parking and anti-collision systems in automobiles. We have also built various Ultrasonic Sensor projects in the past,
 such as water level detection, Ultrasonic Radar, and so on. This is a quick and accurate approach to measure tiny distances. 
 We utilised the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with the Atmega328 in this project to calculate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor.
 ECHO is the fundamental basis of ultrasonic distance measurement. After striking on the ground, sound waves travel through the surroundings
 and return to the source as ECHO. So, after striking the obstruction, we only need to calculate the travel time of both noises, 
 i.e., the departing time and the return time to origin. Because we know the speed of sound, we can determine the distance with a little math.
           
 ## RESEARCH
 Nowadays, getting the distance we want to measure is a bit of a challenge. Even though using a measuring tape is a simple choice,
 this type of equipment has a manual error limit. Engineers had previously developed a range finder module, but they discovered that it had a 
 number of drawbacks, including distance limitations, varying results for different coloured obstructions, and the necessity for calibration every time it
 was used. Human error is always present when manually measuring distances. The major goal of this project is to measure low range distances accurately 
 and consistently. Ultrasonic sensors are utilised in this project to measure distance.
           
 ## FEATURES AND COST AND TIMELINE
 1) It's used to figure out how far away an obstacle is.
 2) This technique is employed in parking sensors and obstacle warning systems in automobiles.
 3) Robots that monitor the terrain 
           
 ## DEFINING OUR SYSTEM 
 HC-SR04 with ATMEGA328p distance measuring With the help of the HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor, ATMEGA328p microcontroller,
 and LCD Display through I2C interface, I was able to measure distance in centimetres in this project.
 ###### Principle:
 The ultrasonic module puts out an 8cycle burst of 40kHz that hits the item surface and returns to produce an echo pulse,
 which is generated by Timer2 of the ATMEGA328p. This pulse's pulse width is related to the distance between the module and the Object.
 The screen is an LCD with an embedded device that converts serial data (through the I2C bus) into a parallel stream of bits.
 Input capture module of the ATMEGA was used to capture the time between rising and falling edges of the echo pulse. 
 The prescaler of this unit was chosen, such that the resolution of pulse-width is 16uS.
 The display in use is LCD which has an integrated chip that converts serial data (via I2C bus) into parallel stream of bits for the LCD.

 ## 4W's and 1'H
 ###### WHAT:
 Distance is a numerical representation of the distance between two objects or points.
 The use of an ultrasonic sensor makes distance measurement simple.
 ###### WHY:
 Ultrasonic sensors are excellent tools for measuring distance and detecting objects without making physical contact. 
 It has a wide range of applications.
 ###### WHERE:
 Measuring liquid level, assessing proximity, and, more recently, assisting in self-parking or anti-collision systems in autos.
 ###### WHEN: 
 The ultrasonic sensor sends out a high-frequency sound pulse, and the distance is calculated based on the time it takes for the echo
 signal to return after reflecting from the intended target. In air, sound travels at 341 metres per second. 
 The distance will be displayed on the LCD display after it has been calculated.
 ###### How:
 We utilised the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with the ATMEGA328 in this project to calculate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor.
 ECHO is the fundamental basis of ultrasonic distance measurement.
