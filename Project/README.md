### INTRODUCTION
Ultrasonic sensors are excellent tools for measuring distance and detecting objects without making physical contact. It has a variety of uses, including detecting liquid levels, determining proximity, and, more recently, assisting in self-parking and anti-collision systems in automobiles. We have also built various Ultrasonic Sensor projects in the past, such as water level detection, Ultrasonic Radar, and so on. This is a quick and accurate approach to measure tiny distances. We utilised the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with the Atmega328 in this project to calculate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor. ECHO is the fundamental basis of ultrasonic distance measurement. After striking on the ground, sound waves travel through the surroundings and return to the source as ECHO. So, after striking the obstruction, we only need to calculate the travel time of both noises, i.e., the departing time and the return time to origin. Because we know the speed of sound, we can determine the distance with a little math.
